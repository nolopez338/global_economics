		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A student entrepreneur is evaluating a short-term retail opportunity that depends heavily on how customer traffic develops during the weekend. The decision is straightforward in structure but uncertain in outcome, because actual demand can shift quickly based on consumer mood and local conditions. Management therefore needs a probability-based framework to connect each demand scenario with its corresponding financial consequence and to justify the final choice on expected performance rather than intuition.

		A coffee shop chain must select a bean purchasing approach for the next month while demand remains uncertain. One alternative emphasizes product quality and brand positioning, while the other emphasizes sourcing flexibility and cost control. Because the market can evolve in more than one direction, leadership must evaluate how each plan performs across possible demand states and use expected value reasoning to support a disciplined, forward-looking decision.

		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A small factory is planning seasonal production and must choose between two operating modes with different cost structures and responsiveness profiles. Market conditions may strengthen, remain stable, or soften, and each state creates a different profit implication for each mode.
