		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A student entrepreneur is evaluating a short-term retail opportunity that depends heavily on how customer traffic develops during the weekend. The decision is straightforward in structure but uncertain in outcome, because actual demand can shift quickly based on consumer mood and local conditions. Management therefore needs a probability-based framework to connect each demand scenario with its corresponding financial consequence and to justify the final choice on expected performance rather than intuition.

				State of nature & Probability & Rent kiosk \\
				\midrule
				High demand & 0.60 & 36 \\
				Low demand & 0.40 & 10 \\
				\bottomrule
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}

		Which alternative should management choose according to the Expected Value criterion?

		\subsection*{Solution}
		\textbf{Step 1 --- Apply the Expected Value formula.}
		\[
		EV(A_i)=\sum [\text{Payoff}\times\text{Probability}]
		\]
		For the kiosk decision:
		\[
		EV(\text{Rent kiosk})=(36\times0.60)+(10\times0.40)
		\]
		\[
		EV(\text{Rent kiosk})=21.6+4.0=25.6
		\]
		
		\textbf{Step 2 --- Compare expected values.}
		There is only one alternative, so its expected value is $25.6$.
		
		\textbf{Step 3 --- Final decision in business language.}
		Based on the expected value criterion, the entrepreneur should proceed with renting the kiosk because the project yields an expected profit of $25.6$ hundred dollars under the stated demand probabilities.		\item
		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A coffee shop chain must select a bean purchasing approach for the next month while demand remains uncertain. One alternative emphasizes product quality and brand positioning, while the other emphasizes sourcing flexibility and cost control. Because the market can evolve in more than one direction, leadership must evaluate how each plan performs across possible demand states and use expected value reasoning to support a disciplined, forward-looking decision.

				High demand & 0.55 & 84 & 72 \\
				Low demand & 0.45 & 22 & 34 \\
				\bottomrule
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}

		Which alternative should management choose according to the Expected Value criterion?

		\subsection*{Solution}
		\textbf{Step 1 --- Apply the Expected Value formula.}
		\[
		EV(A_i)=\sum [\text{Payoff}\times\text{Probability}]
		\]
		\[
		EV(\text{Plan A})=(84\times0.55)+(22\times0.45)

		\[
		EV(\text{Plan B})=(72\times0.55)+(34\times0.45)
		\]
		\[
		EV(\text{Plan B})=39.6+15.3=54.9
		\]
		
		\textbf{Step 2 --- Compare expected values.}
		$EV(\text{Plan A})=56.1$ and $EV(\text{Plan B})=54.9$, so Plan A has the higher expected value.
		
		\textbf{Step 3 --- Final decision in business language.}
		Using the expected value criterion, the chain should adopt Plan A because it provides the highest expected monthly profit under the current demand outlook.		\item
		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A small factory is planning seasonal production and must choose between two operating modes with different cost structures and responsiveness profiles. Market conditions may strengthen, remain stable, or soften, and each state creates a different profit implication for each mode. Since management cannot know in advance which condition will occur, the decision should be anchored in expected value so that uncertainty is incorporated systematically into the production strategy.

				Weak market & 0.25 & 18 & 30 \\
				\bottomrule
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}

		Which alternative should management choose according to the Expected Value criterion?

		\subsection*{Solution}
		\textbf{Step 1 --- Apply the Expected Value formula.}
		\[
		EV(A_i)=\sum [\text{Payoff}\times\text{Probability}]
		\]
		\[
		EV(\text{Mode A})=(95\times0.30)+(60\times0.45)+(18\times0.25)
		\]
		\[
		EV(\text{Mode A})=28.5+27.0+4.5=60.0
		\]
		\[
		EV(\text{Mode B})=(88\times0.30)+(66\times0.45)+(30\times0.25)
		\]
		\[
		EV(\text{Mode B})=26.4+29.7+7.5=63.6
		\]
		
		\textbf{Step 2 --- Compare expected values.}
		$EV(\text{Mode A})=60.0$ and $EV(\text{Mode B})=63.6$, so Mode B is superior on expected value.
		
		\textbf{Step 3 --- Final decision in business language.}
		The factory should select Mode B because it maximizes expected seasonal profit once each market condition is weighted by its probability.		\item
		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A delivery startup is selecting a fleet strategy for the coming quarter in an environment where fuel conditions are uncertain and can materially affect operating margins. Each strategic option offers a different balance between control, flexibility, and exposure to cost volatility. To choose responsibly, the firm must evaluate outcomes across the plausible fuel-cost states and rely on expected value to identify the alternative with the strongest overall economic justification.

		\]
		\[
		EV(\text{Strategy C})=24+44+17.5=85.5
		\]
		
		\textbf{Step 2 --- Compare expected values.}
		$EV(\text{A})=84.0$, $EV(\text{B})=87.5$, and $EV(\text{C})=85.5$; Strategy B is the largest.
		
		\textbf{Step 3 --- Final decision in business language.}
		Under the expected value criterion, the startup should choose Strategy B because it delivers the highest expected quarterly profit after accounting for fuel-cost uncertainty.		\item
		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A supermarket is defining an inventory policy for imported fruit while facing uncertainty in supply-chain reliability. Management recognizes that logistics conditions can range from smooth to severely disrupted, and each situation affects availability, waste risk, and revenue potential differently. Because no single scenario is guaranteed, the firm must compare policies using probability-weighted outcomes and select the option that best supports resilient profit performance.

		The highest expected value is Policy C.
		
		\textbf{Step 3 --- Final decision in business language.}
		The supermarket should implement Policy C, since it provides the strongest expected profit performance across the full range of supply-chain outcomes.		\item
		\subsection*{Problem description}
		An electronics retailer is choosing a launch format for a new device in a season where demand intensity may vary significantly. Each format reflects a different channel strategy and operational commitment, leading to distinct financial outcomes under different market conditions. Decision-makers therefore need to assess each format across plausible seasonal states and use expected value analysis to justify the launch approach with the strongest overall return profile.

		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A grain exporter must choose among competing shipping contracts while freight market conditions remain uncertain. Contract design influences both upside potential and downside protection as freight tightness changes across the planning horizon. Since management cannot predict a single freight outcome with certainty, it should evaluate all contracts under the full set of plausible states and apply expected value logic to support a defensible commercial decision.

		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A fashion retailer is evaluating expansion plans for urban markets where demand can shift across several intensity levels. Each plan reflects a different growth posture, creating distinct exposure to both strong and weak market outcomes.

		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A regional energy distributor is selecting a pricing package in a context where weather-driven demand can change materially during the operating period. Each package offers a different trade-off between high-demand capture and low-demand protection. Because weather patterns are uncertain and financially significant, management needs a probability-weighted evaluation of outcomes to determine which package provides the most robust expected economic result.

		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A national logistics group is deciding on a network design while macro-economic conditions may evolve through expansion, slowdown, contraction, and recovery patterns. Each design presents a different balance between growth capacity and resilience under weaker environments. Given this broad uncertainty set, executives should compare all designs across the plausible states of nature and rely on expected value analysis to choose the configuration with the strongest expected performance.

		\textbf{Step 2 --- Compare expected values.}
		Among the six designs, Design E has the largest expected value at $183.0$.
		
		\textbf{Step 3 --- Final decision in business language.}
		Using the expected value criterion, management should implement Design E because it provides the highest expected profit across the projected macro-economic distribution.
