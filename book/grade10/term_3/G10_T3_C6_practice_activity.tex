\ExamSection{C6 Employs the standardisation of the normal variable in real-life problems.}

\begin{ExamProblems}

\item
\subsection*{Problem 1 — Exam Performance Benchmark}

\textbf{Problem.}
Mathematics test marks at a school are modeled by a normal variable
\(X\sim N(70,8^2)\), where marks are out of 100.

\textbf{Question.}
Find the probability that a randomly selected student scores above 82 marks.
Show the standardisation step clearly.

\textbf{Solution.}
Use
\[
Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}=\frac{X-70}{8}.
\]
Then
\[
P(X>82)=P\!\left(Z>\frac{82-70}{8}\right)=P(Z>1.50).
\]
From the standard normal table, \(\Phi(1.50)=0.9332\).
So
\[
P(Z>1.50)=1-\Phi(1.50)=1-0.9332=0.0668.
\]
\textbf{Interpretation.}
About 6.68\% of students are expected to score above 82.

\item
\subsection*{Problem 2 — Delivery Time Reliability}

\textbf{Problem.}
Delivery times for online orders are normally distributed as
\(X\sim N(56,5^2)\), where \(X\) is measured in minutes.

\textbf{Question.}
Find the probability that an order is delivered in less than 50 minutes.
Show the standardisation step clearly.

\textbf{Solution.}
Standardise with
\[
Z=\frac{X-56}{5}.
\]
Then
\[
P(X<50)=P\!\left(Z<\frac{50-56}{5}\right)=P(Z<-1.20).
\]
Using symmetry with the table value \(\Phi(1.20)=0.8849\):
\[
\Phi(-1.20)=1-\Phi(1.20)=1-0.8849=0.1151.
\]
Hence
\[
P(X<50)=0.1151.
\]
\textbf{Interpretation.}
There is an 11.51\% chance a delivery takes less than 50 minutes.

\item
\subsection*{Problem 3 — Apple Mass Acceptance Band}

\textbf{Problem.}
The mass of apples in a packing center follows
\(X\sim N(182,8^2)\), with \(X\) in grams.

\textbf{Question.}
Find the probability that an apple has mass between 170 g and 194 g.
Show the standardisation step clearly.

\textbf{Solution.}
Use
\[
Z=\frac{X-182}{8}.
\]
For the bounds:
\[
z_1=\frac{170-182}{8}=-1.50,
\qquad
z_2=\frac{194-182}{8}=1.50.
\]
So
\[
P(170\le X\le 194)=P(-1.50\le Z\le 1.50)=\Phi(1.50)-\Phi(-1.50).
\]
From the table, \(\Phi(1.50)=0.9332\), and
\[
\Phi(-1.50)=1-\Phi(1.50)=1-0.9332=0.0668.
\]
Therefore
\[
P(170\le X\le 194)=0.9332-0.0668=0.8664.
\]
\textbf{Interpretation.}
About 86.64\% of apples are expected to be between 170 g and 194 g.

\item
\subsection*{Problem 4 — Commute Duration Window}

\textbf{Problem.}
Students' commute times are modeled by
\(X\sim N(30,4^2)\), where \(X\) is in minutes.

\textbf{Question.}
Find the probability that a student commute lasts from 24 to 36 minutes.
Show the standardisation step clearly.

\textbf{Solution.}
Standardise:
\[
Z=\frac{X-30}{4}.
\]
Then
\[
z_1=\frac{24-30}{4}=-1.50,
\qquad
z_2=\frac{36-30}{4}=1.50.
\]
Hence
\[
P(24\le X\le 36)=P(-1.50\le Z\le 1.50)=\Phi(1.50)-\Phi(-1.50).
\]
Using table values, \(\Phi(1.50)=0.9332\) and
\(\Phi(-1.50)=1-0.9332=0.0668\):
\[
P(24\le X\le 36)=0.9332-0.0668=0.8664.
\]
\textbf{Interpretation.}
There is an 86.64\% chance a commute is between 24 and 36 minutes.

\item
\subsection*{Problem 5 — Battery Life Threshold}

\textbf{Problem.}
A phone battery life test result is modeled by
\(X\sim N(10,0.8^2)\), where \(X\) is in hours of use.

\textbf{Question.}
Find the probability that a battery lasts longer than 11.2 hours.
Show the standardisation step clearly.

\textbf{Solution.}
Use
\[
Z=\frac{X-10}{0.8}.
\]
Then
\[
P(X>11.2)=P\!\left(Z>\frac{11.2-10}{0.8}\right)=P(Z>1.50).
\]
From the table, \(\Phi(1.50)=0.9332\). So
\[
P(Z>1.50)=1-0.9332=0.0668.
\]
Therefore
\[
P(X>11.2)=0.0668.
\]
\textbf{Interpretation.}
Only about 6.68\% of batteries are expected to exceed 11.2 hours.

% --------------------------------------------------

\item
\subsection*{Problem 6 — Streaming Download Speed Band}

\textbf{Problem.}
Home streaming download speed is modeled by
\(X\sim N(44,5^2)\), with \(X\) measured in Mbps.

\textbf{Question.}
Find the probability that the speed is between 38 Mbps and 50 Mbps.
Show the standardisation step clearly.

\textbf{Solution.}
Standardise:
\[
Z=\frac{X-44}{5}.
\]
Endpoint z-scores:
\[
z_1=\frac{38-44}{5}=-1.20,
\qquad
z_2=\frac{50-44}{5}=1.20.
\]
So
\[
P(38\le X\le 50)=P(-1.20\le Z\le 1.20)=\Phi(1.20)-\Phi(-1.20).
\]
From the table, \(\Phi(1.20)=0.8849\), and
\[
\Phi(-1.20)=1-\Phi(1.20)=1-0.8849=0.1151.
\]
Thus
\[
P(38\le X\le 50)=0.8849-0.1151=0.7698.
\]
\textbf{Interpretation.}
About 76.98\% of download-speed readings lie between 38 Mbps and 50 Mbps.

\item
\subsection*{Problem 7 — Coffee Shop Queue Extremes}

\textbf{Problem.}
Queue waiting time at a coffee shop is modeled by
\(X\sim N(8,2.5^2)\), where \(X\) is in minutes.

\textbf{Question.}
Find the probability that a customer waits at most 4 minutes or at least 12 minutes.
Show the standardisation step clearly.

\textbf{Solution.}
Use
\[
Z=\frac{X-8}{2.5}.
\]
Compute z-scores:
\[
z_a=\frac{4-8}{2.5}=-1.60,
\qquad
z_b=\frac{12-8}{2.5}=1.60.
\]
Then
\[
P(X\le 4\ \text{or}\ X\ge 12)=P(Z\le -1.60)+P(Z\ge 1.60).
\]
From the table, \(\Phi(1.60)=0.9452\), so
\[
P(Z\le -1.60)=\Phi(-1.60)=1-0.9452=0.0548,
\]
\[
P(Z\ge 1.60)=1-\Phi(1.60)=1-0.9452=0.0548.
\]
Therefore
\[
P(X\le 4\ \text{or}\ X\ge 12)=0.0548+0.0548=0.1096.
\]
\textbf{Interpretation.}
There is a 10.96\% chance of a very short or very long queue wait.

\item
\subsection*{Problem 8 — Daily Screen-On Time}

\textbf{Problem.}
A student's daily phone screen-on time is modeled by
\(X\sim N(3.6,1.0^2)\), where \(X\) is in hours.

\textbf{Question.}
Find the probability that screen-on time is between 2.4 h and 4.8 h.
Show the standardisation step clearly.

\textbf{Solution.}
Standardise:
\[
Z=\frac{X-3.6}{1.0}.
\]
Then
\[
z_1=\frac{2.4-3.6}{1.0}=-1.20,
\qquad
z_2=\frac{4.8-3.6}{1.0}=1.20.
\]
So
\[
P(2.4\le X\le 4.8)=P(-1.20\le Z\le 1.20)=\Phi(1.20)-\Phi(-1.20).
\]
Using \(\Phi(1.20)=0.8849\) and \(\Phi(-1.20)=1-0.8849=0.1151\):
\[
P(2.4\le X\le 4.8)=0.8849-0.1151=0.7698.
\]
\textbf{Interpretation.}
The model predicts a 76.98\% chance that daily screen time is between 2.4 and 4.8 hours.

% --------------------------------------------------

\item
\subsection*{Problem 9 — Daily Step Count Extremes}

\textbf{Problem.}
A teen's daily step count is modeled by
\(X\sim N(9000,1250^2)\), where \(X\) is in steps.

\textbf{Question.}
Find the probability that the step count is at most 6800 steps or at least 11\,200 steps.
Show the standardisation step clearly.

\textbf{Solution.}
Use
\[
Z=\frac{X-9000}{1250}.
\]
Compute:
\[
z_a=\frac{6800-9000}{1250}=-1.76,
\qquad
z_b=\frac{11200-9000}{1250}=1.76.
\]
Therefore
\[
P(X\le 6800\ \text{or}\ X\ge 11200)=P(Z\le -1.76)+P(Z\ge 1.76).
\]
From the table, \(\Phi(1.76)=0.9608\). Hence
\[
P(Z\le -1.76)=\Phi(-1.76)=1-0.9608=0.0392,
\]
\[
P(Z\ge 1.76)=1-\Phi(1.76)=1-0.9608=0.0392.
\]
So
\[
P(X\le 6800\ \text{or}\ X\ge 11200)=0.0392+0.0392=0.0784.
\]
\textbf{Interpretation.}
There is a 7.84\% chance of a very low or very high daily step count.

\item
\subsection*{Problem 10 — Classroom Temperature Comfort Range}

\textbf{Problem.}
Hourly classroom temperature readings are modeled by
\(X\sim N(22.0,1.25^2)\), where \(X\) is in \(^\circ\)C.

\textbf{Question.}
Find the probability that a reading is between 20.5\(^\circ\)C and 24.0\(^\circ\)C.
Show the standardisation step clearly.

\textbf{Solution.}
Standardise with
\[
Z=\frac{X-22.0}{1.25}.
\]
Compute z-scores:
\[
z_1=\frac{20.5-22.0}{1.25}=-1.20,
\qquad
z_2=\frac{24.0-22.0}{1.25}=1.60.
\]
So
\[
P(20.5\le X\le 24.0)=P(-1.20\le Z\le 1.60)=\Phi(1.60)-\Phi(-1.20).
\]
From the table, \(\Phi(1.60)=0.9452\) and \(\Phi(-1.20)=1-\Phi(1.20)=1-0.8849=0.1151\).
Thus
\[
P(20.5\le X\le 24.0)=0.9452-0.1151=0.8301.
\]
\textbf{Interpretation.}
The probability that the room temperature stays in this comfort range is 83.01\%.
