		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A school cafeteria wants to estimate the average number of fruit servings sold per day.
		A random sample of 8 days is recorded as raw data (servings per day): 12, 15, 14, 16, 13, 17, 15, 14.
		The cafeteria has a historical estimate of the population standard deviation, \(\sigma = 2.4\) servings.
		For classroom purposes, suppose the true population mean is \(\mu = 15\) servings.
		Construct and interpret a 90\% confidence interval, a 95\% confidence interval, and a 99\% confidence interval for the population mean number of servings sold per day.

		\subsection*{C1}
		First, we calculate the sample mean.
		\[
		\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x}{n} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \sum x = 12 + 15 + 14 + 16 + 13 + 17 + 15 + 14 = 116 \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \bar{x} = \frac{116}{8} = 14.5
		\]
		Second, we calculate the sample variance and then the sample standard deviation.
		\[
		s^2 = \frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}
		\]
		\[
		\sum (x-\bar{x})^2 = (12-14.5)^2 + (15-14.5)^2 + (14-14.5)^2 + (16-14.5)^2 + (13-14.5)^2 + (17-14.5)^2 + (15-14.5)^2 + (14-14.5)^2 = 18
		\]
		\[
		s^2 = \frac{18}{8-1} \approx 2.57 \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad s = \sqrt{s^2} \approx 1.60
		\]

		\subsection*{C2}
		The population parameters are $\mu$ and $\sigma = 2.4$, while the sample statistics are $\bar{x} = 14.5$ and $s \approx 1.60$. The sample mean $\bar{x}$ estimates the population mean $\mu$, and the sample standard deviation $s$ estimates $\sigma$ even though $\sigma$ is given here. This comparison shows that inference about the mean depends on sample statistics when the population mean is unknown.

		\subsection*{C3}
		The sample includes only 8 days, so a single point estimate could miss the true mean because of sampling variability. An interval estimate is preferred because it accounts for that uncertainty and gives a range of plausible values for $\mu$. For planning cafeteria inventory, a range of likely daily servings is more informative than a single number.

		\subsection*{C5}
		With known $\sigma = 2.4$ and $n=8$,
		\[
		SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad SE = \frac{2.4}{\sqrt{8}} \approx 0.85
		\]
		For 90\% confidence, $z_{0.05}=1.645$.
		\[
		E_{90} = z_{0.05} \cdot SE \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad E_{90} = 1.645(0.85) \approx 1.40
		\]
		\[
		\mu \in \bar{x} \pm E_{90} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \mu \in 14.5 \pm 1.40 = [14.5 - 1.40, 14.5 + 1.40] = [13.10, 15.90]
		\]
		For 95\% confidence, $z_{0.025}=1.96$.
		\[
		E_{95} = z_{0.025} \cdot SE \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad E_{95} = 1.96(0.85) \approx 1.66
		\]
		\[
		\mu \in \bar{x} \pm E_{95} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \mu \in 14.5 \pm 1.66 = [14.5 - 1.66, 14.5 + 1.66] = [12.84, 16.16]
		\]
		For 99\% confidence, $z_{0.005}=2.576$.
		\[
		E_{99} = z_{0.005} \cdot SE \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad E_{99} = 2.576(0.85) \approx 2.19
		\]
		\[
		\mu \in \bar{x} \pm E_{99} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \mu \in 14.5 \pm 2.19 = [14.5 - 2.19, 14.5 + 2.19] = [12.31, 16.69]
		\]

		\subsection*{C4}
		We are 90\% confident the true mean daily servings is between about 13.10 and 15.90 servings, 95\% confident it is between about 12.84 and 16.16 servings, and 99\% confident it is between about 12.31 and 16.69 servings. The confidence level means that in repeated sampling about 90\%, 95\%, or 99\% of the resulting intervals would capture $\mu$, and it does not mean there is a 90\%, 95\%, or 99\% chance that $\mu$ lies in one specific interval. Since the classroom value $\mu = 15$ is inside all three intervals, the sample supports that value as plausible for the cafeteria.

		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A city library wants to estimate the average number of study rooms booked per day.
		Two different random samples are drawn from the same population of daily bookings.
		The first sample (Sample A) records 18, 20, 19, 21, 17, 22 bookings and the second sample (Sample B) records 16, 18, 17, 19, 20 bookings.
		The population standard deviation is known from long-term records to be \(\sigma = 3.2\) bookings.
		For classroom purposes, suppose the true population mean is \(\mu = 19\) bookings.
		Construct and interpret a 95\% confidence interval for the population mean based on each sample.

		\subsection*{C1}
		First, we calculate the sample means.
		\[
		\bar{x}_A = \frac{\sum x_A}{n_A} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \sum x_A = 18 + 20 + 19 + 21 + 17 + 22 = 117 \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \bar{x}_A = \frac{117}{6} = 19.5
		\]
		\[
		\bar{x}_B = \frac{\sum x_B}{n_B}  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \sum x_B = 16 + 18 + 17 + 19 + 20 = 90  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \bar{x}_B = \frac{90}{5} = 18
		\]
		Second, we calculate the sample variance and then the sample standard deviation.
		\[
		s_A^2 = \frac{\sum (x_A-\bar{x}_A)^2}{n_A-1} \qquad \qquad s_B^2 = \frac{\sum (x_B-\bar{x}_B)^2}{n_B-1}
		\]
		\[
		\sum (x_A-\bar{x}_A)^2 = (18-19.5)^2 + (20-19.5)^2 + (19-19.5)^2 + (21-19.5)^2 + (17-19.5)^2 + (22-19.5)^2 = 17.5
		\]
		\[
		s_A^2 = \frac{17.5}{6-1} = 3.5 \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad s_A = \sqrt{s_A^2} \approx 1.87
		\]
		\[
		\sum (x_B-\bar{x}_B)^2 = (16-18)^2 + (18-18)^2 + (17-18)^2 + (19-18)^2 + (20-18)^2 = 10
		\]
		\[
		s_B^2 = \frac{10}{5-1} = 2.5  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad s_B = \sqrt{s_B^2} \approx 1.58
		\]

		\subsection*{C2}
		The population parameters are $\mu$ and $\sigma = 3.2$, while the sample statistics are $\bar{x}_A = 19.5$, $s_A \approx 1.87$, $\bar{x}_B = 18$, and $s_B \approx 1.58$. The values $\bar{x}_A$ and $\bar{x}_B$ estimate the population mean $\mu$, and $s_A$ and $s_B$ estimate the spread even though $\sigma$ is known for this exercise. This comparison shows that statistical inference relies on sample statistics when the population mean is not directly observed.

		\subsection*{C3}
		A single point estimate can miss the true mean because of sampling variability in the booking counts. A confidence interval is preferred because it accounts for that uncertainty and gives a range of plausible values for $\mu$. For planning daily staffing, a range is more informative than one value.

		\subsection*{C5}
		With known $\sigma = 3.2$ and $n_A = 6$, for 95\% confidence, $z_{0.025}=1.96$.
		\[
		SE_A = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n_A}}  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad SE_A = \frac{3.2}{\sqrt{6}} \approx 1.31  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad  E_A = z_{0.025} \cdot SE_A = 1.96(1.31) \approx 2.56
		\]
		\[
		\mu \in \bar{x}_A \pm E_A  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \mu \in 19.5 \pm 2.56 = [19.5 - 2.56, 19.5 + 2.56] = [16.94, 22.06]
		\]
		With known $\sigma = 3.2$ and $n_B = 5$,
		\[
		SE_B = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n_B}}  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad SE_B = \frac{3.2}{\sqrt{5}} \approx 1.43  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad  E_B = z_{0.025} \cdot SE_B = 1.96(1.43) \approx 2.80
		\]
		\[
		\mu \in \bar{x}_B \pm E_B   \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \mu \in 18 \pm 2.80 = [18 - 2.80, 18 + 2.80] = [15.20, 20.80]
		\]

		\subsection*{C4}
		We are 95\% confident the true mean daily bookings in the population is between about 16.94 and 22.06 bookings based on Sample A, and 95\% confident it is between about 15.20 and 20.80 bookings based on Sample B. The confidence level means that in repeated sampling about 95\% of the resulting intervals would capture $\mu$, and it does not mean there is a 95\% chance that $\mu$ lies in one specific interval. Since both samples come from the same population, the two intervals are estimating the same parameter $\mu$, and both intervals include the classroom value $\mu = 19$ as plausible.

		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A training center tracks the number of completed modules per week.
		A random sample of 30 weeks is summarized in grouped form. The population standard deviation is known to be \(\sigma = 4.5\) modules per week.
		For academic purposes, assume the true population mean is \(\mu = 14\) modules per week.
		The grouped data pairs list modules per week first and the frequency (number of weeks) second: \(9 \rightarrow 6\), \(12 \rightarrow 10\), \(15 \rightarrow 8\), and \(18 \rightarrow 6\).
		Construct and interpret a 90\% confidence interval, a 95\% confidence interval, and a 99\% confidence interval for the population mean modules per week.

		\subsection*{C1}
		Using grouped values $x$ with frequencies $f$.
		\[
		n = \sum f   \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad n = 6 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 30
		\]
		\[
		\bar{x} = \frac{\sum f x}{n} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \sum f x = 6(9) + 10(12) + 8(15) + 6(18) = 402  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \bar{x} = \frac{402}{30} = 13.4
		\]
		Second, we calculate the sample variance and then the sample standard deviation $s$.
		\[
		s^2 = \frac{\sum f(x-\bar{x})^2}{n-1} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \sum f(x-\bar{x})^2 = 6(9-13.4)^2 + 10(12-13.4)^2 + 8(15-13.4)^2 + 6(18-13.4)^2
		\]
		\[
		\sum f(x-\bar{x})^2 = 116.16 + 19.6 + 20.48 + 126.96 = 283.2
		\]
		\[
		s^2 = \frac{283.2}{30-1} \approx 9.77  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad s = \sqrt{s^2} \approx 3.12
		\]

		\subsection*{C2}
		The population parameters are $\mu$ and $\sigma = 4.5$, while the sample statistics are $\bar{x} = 13.4$ and $s \approx 3.12$. The sample mean $\bar{x}$ estimates the population mean $\mu$, and the sample standard deviation $s$ estimates $\sigma$ even though $\sigma$ is given. This comparison shows that inference for the mean depends on sample statistics when the population mean is unknown.

		\subsection*{C3}
		The sample summarizes only 30 weeks, so the true mean could differ from the point estimate because of sampling variability. An interval estimate is preferred because it captures that uncertainty and provides a range of plausible values for $\mu$. For planning training schedules, a plausible range for the completion rate is more useful than a single number.

		\subsection*{C5}
		With known $\sigma = 4.5$ and $n=30$,
		\[
		SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad SE = \frac{4.5}{\sqrt{30}} \approx 0.82
		\]
		For 90\% confidence, $z_{0.05}=1.645$.
		\[
		E_{90} = z_{0.05} \cdot SE \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad E_{90} = 1.645(0.82) \approx 1.35

		\[
		\mu \in \bar{x} \pm E_{90} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \mu \in 13.4 \pm 1.35 = [13.4 - 1.35, 13.4 + 1.35] = [12.05, 14.75]

		\]
		For 99\% confidence, $z_{0.005}=2.576$.
		\[
		E_{99} = z_{0.005} \cdot SE \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad E_{99} = 2.576(0.82) \approx 2.12
		\]
		\[
		\mu \in \bar{x} \pm E_{99} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \mu \in 13.4 \pm 2.12 = [13.4 - 2.12, 13.4 + 2.12] = [11.28, 15.52]
		\]

		\subsection*{C4}
		We are 90\% confident the true mean completion rate is between about 12.05 and 14.75 modules, 95\% confident it is between about 11.79 and 15.01 modules, and 99\% confident it is between about 11.28 and 15.52 modules. The confidence level means that in repeated sampling about 90\%, 95\%, or 99\% of such intervals would contain $\mu$, and it does not mean there is a 90\%, 95\%, or 99\% chance that $\mu$ lies in this one interval. Since the classroom value $\mu = 14$ lies in all three intervals, the sample supports that value as plausible for the training center.

The sample means estimate the population mean $\mu$, and the sample standard deviations estimate $\sigma$ even though $\sigma$ is known. This comparison shows that inference for the mean relies on grouped sample statistics when the population mean is unknown.

		\subsection*{C3}
		Each sample represents only 20 shifts, so a point estimate may miss the true mean because of sampling variability.

		Even with 50 observations, a point estimate does not show how much the mean could vary because of sampling variability.

		Sample A has intervals 28--32 (10), 33--37 (15), and 38--42 (9).
		Sample B has intervals 28--32 (8), 33--37 (14), and 38--42 (12).
		The population standard deviation is known to be \(\sigma = 4.1\) minutes.
		For classroom purposes, suppose the true population mean is \(\mu = 35\) minutes.
		Construct and interpret a 95\% confidence interval for the population mean based on each sample.

		\subsection*{C1}
		Using grouped midpoints $x$ with frequencies $f$.
		\[
		n_A = \sum f_A \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad n_A = 10 + 15 + 9 = 34
		\]
		\[
		\bar{x}_A = \frac{\sum f_A x}{n_A} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \sum f_A x = 10(30) + 15(35) + 9(40) = 1185 \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \bar{x}_A = \frac{1185}{34} \approx 34.85
		\]
		\[
		\sum f_A(x-\bar{x}_A)^2 = 10(30-34.85)^2 + 15(35-34.85)^2 + 9(40-34.85)^2
		\]
		\[
		\sum f_A(x-\bar{x}_A)^2 \approx 235.51 + 0.32 + 238.43 = 474.26
		\]
		\[
		s_A^2 = \frac{474.26}{34-1} \approx 14.37 \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad s_A = \sqrt{s_A^2} \approx 3.79
		\]
		\[
		n_B = \sum f_B \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad n_B = 8 + 14 + 12 = 34
		\]
		\[
		\bar{x}_B = \frac{\sum f_B x}{n_B} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \sum f_B x = 8(30) + 14(35) + 12(40) = 1210 \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \bar{x}_B = \frac{1210}{34} \approx 35.59
		\]
		\[
		\sum f_B(x-\bar{x}_B)^2 = 8(30-35.59)^2 + 14(35-35.59)^2 + 12(40-35.59)^2
		\]
		\[
		\sum f_B(x-\bar{x}_B)^2 \approx 249.83 + 4.84 + 233.56 = 488.24
		\]
		\[
		s_B^2 = \frac{488.24}{34-1} \approx 14.80 \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad s_B = \sqrt{s_B^2} \approx 3.85
		\]

		\subsection*{C2}
		The population parameters are $\mu$ and $\sigma = 4.1$, while the sample statistics are $\bar{x}_A \approx 34.85$, $s_A \approx 3.79$, $\bar{x}_B \approx 35.59$, and $s_B \approx 3.85$. The sample means estimate the population mean $\mu$, and the sample standard deviations estimate $\sigma$ even though $\sigma$ is known. This comparison shows that inference for the mean relies on grouped sample statistics when the population mean is unknown.

		\subsection*{C3}
		Each sample represents only 34 calls, so a point estimate may miss the true mean because of sampling variability. An interval estimate is preferred because it captures that uncertainty and gives a range of plausible values for $\mu$. For staffing the call center, a plausible range for average call length is more useful than a single number.

		\subsection*{C5}
		With known $\sigma = 4.1$ and $n_A = 34$, for 95\% confidence, $z_{0.025}=1.96$.
		\[
		SE_A = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n_A}}  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad SE_A = \frac{4.1}{\sqrt{34}} \approx 0.70  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad  E_A = z_{0.025} \cdot SE_A = 1.96(0.70) \approx 1.38
		\]
		\[
		\mu \in \bar{x}_A \pm E_A  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \mu \in 34.85 \pm 1.38 = [34.85 - 1.38, 34.85 + 1.38] = [33.47, 36.23]
		\]
		With known $\sigma = 4.1$ and $n_B = 34$,
		\[
		SE_B = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n_B}}  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad SE_B = \frac{4.1}{\sqrt{34}} \approx 0.70  \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad  E_B = z_{0.025} \cdot SE_B = 1.96(0.70) \approx 1.38
		\]
		\[
		\mu \in \bar{x}_B \pm E_B   \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \mu \in 35.59 \pm 1.38 = [35.59 - 1.38, 35.59 + 1.38] = [34.21, 36.97]
		\]

		\subsection*{C4}
		We are 95\% confident the true mean call length is between about 33.47 and 36.23 minutes based on Sample A, and 95\% confident it is between about 34.21 and 36.97 minutes based on Sample B. The confidence level means that in repeated sampling about 95\% of the resulting intervals would capture $\mu$, and it does not mean there is a 95\% chance that $\mu$ lies in one specific interval. Since both samples come from the same population, the two intervals are estimating the same parameter $\mu$, and both intervals include the classroom value $\mu = 35$ as plausible.

		\subsection*{Problem description}
		A manufacturing plant monitors the weight (in grams) of packaged items.
		Most of the data are summarized in grouped values, but a few extreme packages were recorded separately as outliers.
		The grouped data are 50 $\rightarrow$ 8, 55 $\rightarrow$ 12, and 60 $\rightarrow$ 10.
		The outlier raw observations are 72, 74, and 45 grams.
		The population standard deviation is known to be \(\sigma = 6.0\) grams.
		For classroom purposes, suppose the true population mean is \(\mu = 56\) grams.
		Construct and interpret a 95\% confidence interval for the population mean package weight.

		\subsection*{C1}
		Using grouped values $x$ with frequencies $f$, plus raw outliers.
		\[
		n = \sum f + \text{(number of outliers)} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad n = (8 + 12 + 10) + 3 = 33
		\]
		\[
		\bar{x} = \frac{\sum f x + \sum x_{\text{out}}}{n} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \sum f x = 8(50) + 12(55) + 10(60) = 1660
		\]
		\[
		\sum x_{\text{out}} = 72 + 74 + 45 = 191 \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \bar{x} = \frac{1660 + 191}{33} \approx 56.09
		\]
		Second, we calculate the sample variance and then the sample standard deviation.
		\[
		s^2 = \frac{\sum f(x-\bar{x})^2 + \sum (x_{\text{out}}-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}
		\]
		\[
		\sum f(x-\bar{x})^2 = 8(50-56.09)^2 + 12(55-56.09)^2 + 10(60-56.09)^2
		\]
		\[
		\sum f(x-\bar{x})^2 \approx 296.79 + 14.28 + 152.81 = 463.88
		\]
		\[
		\sum (x_{\text{out}}-\bar{x})^2 = (72-56.09)^2 + (74-56.09)^2 + (45-56.09)^2 \approx 253.10 + 320.74 + 123.01 = 696.85
		\]
		\[
		s^2 = \frac{463.88 + 696.85}{33-1} \approx 36.27 \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad s = \sqrt{s^2} \approx 6.02
		\]

		\subsection*{C2}
		The population parameters are $\mu$ and $\sigma = 6.0$, while the sample statistics are $\bar{x} \approx 56.09$ and $s \approx 6.02$. The sample mean $\bar{x}$ estimates the population mean $\mu$, and the sample standard deviation $s$ estimates $\sigma$ even though $\sigma$ is given. This comparison shows that inference for the mean relies on combining grouped data and raw outliers to compute consistent sample statistics.

		\subsection*{C3}
		The combined sample includes only 33 packages, and the outliers show that some packages are far from the typical grouped values. A confidence interval is preferred because it reflects this variability and gives a range of plausible values for $\mu$. For quality control, a range of likely mean weights is more informative than a single value.

		\subsection*{C5}
		With known $\sigma = 6.0$ and $n=33$, for 95\% confidence, $z_{0.025}=1.96$.
		\[
		SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad SE = \frac{6.0}{\sqrt{33}} \approx 1.04
		\]
		\[
		E = z_{0.025} \cdot SE \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad E = 1.96(1.04) \approx 2.05
		\]
		\[
		\mu \in \bar{x} \pm E \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad \mu \in 56.09 \pm 2.05 = [56.09 - 2.05, 56.09 + 2.05] = [54.04, 58.14]
		\]

		\subsection*{C4}
		We are 95\% confident the true mean package weight is between about 54.04 and 58.14 grams. The confidence level means that in repeated sampling about 95\% of the resulting intervals would capture $\mu$, and it does not mean there is a 95\% chance that $\mu$ lies in this one interval. The outliers pull the sample mean upward compared with the grouped values alone and increase the spread, which widens the confidence interval; nevertheless, the interval still provides a plausible range for the overall population mean.
