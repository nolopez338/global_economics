		\subsection*{Sample Size Determination for Estimating a Mean Commute Time}
		A transportation planner wants to estimate the mean commute time (in minutes) for a metropolitan rail line. Historical records from previous years report a long-run average commute time of $\mu = 42$ minutes. Past studies show the population standard deviation is $\sigma = 8$ minutes. The planner wants a 99\% confidence estimate with a maximum error of $E = 2$ minutes. Determine the minimum sample size needed.
		
		\subsection*{C6}
		This solution sets the sample size so the margin of error does not exceed the target value by selecting $z^*$, substituting into the formula, and rounding up to the smallest integer that meets the requirement.
		
		Step 1: Identify the target error and confidence level. The maximum error is $E = 2$ minutes and the confidence level is 99\%, so $z^* = 2.576$.
		
		Step 2: Apply the sample size formula.
		\[
		n = \left(\frac{z^*\,\sigma}{E}\right)^2
		= \left(\frac{2.576 \cdot 8}{2}\right)^2
		= \left(10.304\right)^2
		= 106.18
		\]
		
		Step 3: Round up and verify Criterion 6. Round up to $n = 107$. With $n=107$, the margin of error is at most 2 minutes, satisfying Criterion 6.
		
		\item
		\subsection*{Sample Size Determination for Estimating a Mean Weekly Wage}
		A labor analyst wants to estimate the mean weekly wage (in dollars) for a specific industry. Long-term administrative records for this industry report an average weekly wage of $\mu = 820$ dollars. The population standard deviation is known to be $\sigma = 15$ dollars. The analyst needs a 95\% confidence estimate with a maximum error of $E = 3$ dollars. Determine the minimum sample size required.
		
		\subsection*{C6}
		This solution determines the sample size that guarantees the margin of error does not exceed the specified value by using the $z^*$ value and rounding up.
		
		Step 1: Identify the target error and confidence level. The maximum error is $E = 3$ dollars and the confidence level is 95\%, so $z^* = 1.96$.
		
		Step 2: Apply the sample size formula.
		\[
		n = \left(\frac{z^*\,\sigma}{E}\right)^2
		= \left(\frac{1.96 \cdot 15}{3}\right)^2
		= \left(9.80\right)^2
		= 96.04
		\]
		
		Step 3: Round up and verify Criterion 6. Round up to $n = 97$. With $n=97$, the margin of error is at most 3 dollars, satisfying Criterion 6.
		
		\item
		\subsection*{Sample Size Determination for Estimating Mean Crop Yield}
		An agriculture board wants to estimate the mean yield (in tons per hectare) of a crop. Historical production reports for the region indicate a long-run average yield of $\mu = 6.8$ tons per hectare. The population standard deviation is $\sigma = 4.5$ tons per hectare. The board wants a 90\% confidence estimate with a maximum error of $E = 1$ ton per hectare. Determine the minimum sample size required.
		
		\subsection*{C6}
		This solution identifies the target error and confidence level, applies the sample size formula, and rounds up to the smallest acceptable sample size.
		
		Step 1: Identify the target error and confidence level. The maximum error is $E = 1$ ton per hectare and the confidence level is 90\%, so $z^* = 1.645$.
		
		Step 2: Apply the sample size formula.
		\[
		n = \left(\frac{z^*\,\sigma}{E}\right)^2
		= \left(\frac{1.645 \cdot 4.5}{1}\right)^2
		= \left(7.4025\right)^2
		= 54.80
		\]
		
		Step 3: Round up and verify Criterion 6. Round up to $n = 55$. With $n=55$, the margin of error is at most 1 ton per hectare, satisfying Criterion 6.

		\subsection*{Additional Sample Size Needed to Reduce Margin of Error for a Mean}
		A utilities department wants to estimate the mean monthly electricity bill (in dollars). The population standard deviation is $\sigma = 5.2$ dollars, and $n_{\text{current}} = 49$ bills have been recorded. From these 49 bills, a sample mean of $\bar{x} = 120.5$ dollars and a sample standard deviation of $s = 5.0$ dollars were obtained. How many additional observations are required to reduce the margin of error to $E = 1.0$ dollar at 95\% confidence?
		
		\subsection*{C6}
		This subsection determines the required sample size so the margin of error does not exceed the target amount.
		
		Step 1: Use the target error and confidence level. The target margin of error is $E = 1.0$ dollar and for 95\% confidence, $z^* = 1.96$.
		
		Step 2: Compute the required sample size.
		\[
		n_{\text{required}} = \left(\frac{z^*\,\sigma}{E}\right)^2
		= \left(\frac{1.96 \cdot 5.2}{1.0}\right)^2
		= \left(10.192\right)^2
		\approx 103.88
		\]
		
		Step 3: Determine additional observations. Round up to $n_{\text{required}} = 104$. The additional observations needed are $104 - 49 = 55$.
		
		Conclusion. The department needs 55 more observations so the error will not exceed 1.0 dollar.
		
		\item
		\subsection*{Additional Sample Size Needed to Reduce Margin of Error for a Mean Exam Score}
		A school district is estimating the mean final exam score for a course. The population standard deviation is $\sigma = 6$ points, and $n_{\text{current}} = 25$ scores are available. From these scores, a sample mean of $\bar{x} = 78.2$ points and a sample standard deviation of $s = 5.8$ points were obtained. How many additional observations are required to reduce the margin of error to $E = 1.2$ points at 90\% confidence?
		
		\subsection*{C6}
		This subsection determines the required sample size so the margin of error does not exceed the target amount.
		
		Step 1: Use the target error and confidence level. The target margin of error is $E = 1.2$ points and for 90\% confidence, $z^* = 1.645$.
		
		Step 2: Compute the required sample size.
		\[
		n_{\text{required}} = \left(\frac{z^*\,\sigma}{E}\right)^2
		= \left(\frac{1.645 \cdot 6}{1.2}\right)^2
		= \left(8.225\right)^2
		\approx 67.65
		\]
		
		Step 3: Determine additional observations. Round up to $n_{\text{required}} = 68$. The additional observations needed are $68 - 25 = 43$.
		
		Conclusion. The district needs 43 more observations so the error will not exceed 1.2 points.
		
		\item
		\subsection*{Additional Sample Size Needed to Reduce Margin of Error for Mean Water Use}
		A water authority is estimating the mean daily household water use (in liters). The population standard deviation is $\sigma = 18$ liters, and $n_{\text{current}} = 64$ households have been surveyed. From these households, a sample mean of $\bar{x} = 210$ liters and a sample standard deviation of $s = 17.2$ liters were obtained. How many additional observations are required to reduce the margin of error to $E = 4$ liters at 99\% confidence?
		
		\subsection*{C6}
		This subsection determines the required sample size so the margin of error does not exceed the target amount.
		
		Step 1: Use the target error and confidence level. The target margin of error is $E = 4$ liters and for 99\% confidence, $z^* = 2.576$.
		
		Step 2: Compute the required sample size.
		\[
		n_{\text{required}} = \left(\frac{z^*\,\sigma}{E}\right)^2
		= \left(\frac{2.576 \cdot 18}{4}\right)^2
		= \left(11.592\right)^2
		\approx 134.36
		\]
		
		Step 3: Determine additional observations. Round up to $n_{\text{required}} = 135$. The additional observations needed are $135 - 64 = 71$.
		
		Conclusion. The authority needs 71 more observations so the error will not exceed 4 liters.
